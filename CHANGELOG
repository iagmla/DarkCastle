v1.0 - Migration to Q'loQ-RSA, a multi prime, multi modulus implementation of RSA

v0.9 - Encrypted secret key file + passphrase security

v0.8 - Critical Q'loQ security fix

v0.7 - Integration of Q'loQ public key algorithm which replaces the need for passwords.  It also allows for key exchange between two people.

v0.6.9 - toQ won an internal battle and was promoted to Qapla.  Specjal and Zywca to be integrated in BrokenCastle and will no longer be developed for DarkCastle.

v0.6.8 - Critical fixes to toQ

v0.6.7- New 256 bit stream cipher toQ

v0.6.6.6 - Fix bug in Qapla

v0.6.6 - New 256 bit stream cipher Qapla

v0.6.5 - Specjal changes release candidate 2, new cipher Zywca 256 bit block cipher

v0.6.4 - ZanderFish3 256 bit OFB mode, Specjal re-release candidate included for testing purposes only

v0.6.3 - Hardening of Dark

v0.6.2 - Advanced Spock KSA, Finalization of ZanderFish3.  Small cross platform fixes.

v0.6.1 - Fixes for ZanderFish2-CBC on Linux, hopefully.  Adjusted Manja to be one function.

v0.6 - Rewrite of DarkCastle to allow encryption of arbitrary file sizes (limited by uint64_t).  Drop Specjal (it will come back redesigned).  Forked DarkCastle at v0.5.5 as DarkCastleOneShot.

v0.5.5 - Critical fix to Specjal's key scheduler.

v0.5.4 - ZanderFish3 final design.  Specjal redesign.  Add 512 and 1024 bit ZanderFish3.  Fixed Spock's key scheduler for 256 bit keys.  Drop 128 bit support.  Drop ZanderFishU and WildThing.  Docs uploaded.  ZanderFish3 and Specjal docs coming very soon.

v0.5.3 - Fixed ZanderFish2 on all platforms

v0.5.2 - Drop ZanderFishC support

v0.5.1 - Fix critical bug in ZanderFish2/C/U's S-Box generation. Also updated the round key function to be the latest Amagus function.  ZanderFish2 is complete and self audited.  Update mixing function to ZanderFish3 which remains under construction as the design solidifies through the vetting process.

v0.5 - New cipher designs for Amagus, Uvajda, Specjal and ZanderFish3.  Dieharder testing 100 iterations for each cipher and published the dieharder results in each cipher's repo.  Changed castlesmoke.py to clean up after itself.  Zander3 got a new mixing function and formula to calculate rounds based on key length.  Uvajda now uses an addition operation instead of XOR with the previous state.  Amagus has a transposition layer added. Specjal's round function was corrected. This version is not backward compatible and this is hopefully the final design of the ciphers. Also, Uvajda got converted to using structs.

v0.4.7 - Added some word swaps to ZanderFish3.  Should be the last change in the design.

v0.4.6 - Fixed mixing algorithm in ZanderFish3 and tweak placement

v0.4.5 fix 0.4.4, Wild is still in the code base as the key wrapper for Spock

v0.4.4 - More code cleanup, Drop Wild and leave Spock as the only 128 bit cipher, Add ZanderFish2 CTR mode

v0.4.3 - Fix WildThing, Drop Ganja as a cipher, add ZanderFish3 256 bit, ZanderFish code cleanup

v0.4.1 - Add Zanderfish2 in OFB mode - 256 bit

v0.4 - Added nonce/iv for key wrapping.  Dropped algorithms BlueDye, Wrzeszcz, the original ZanderFish.  Corrected key wrapping for Specjal at 512 and 1024 bit key lengths.  Replaced wrzeszcz_random with amagus_random.  This version is not backward compatible and is considered stable.
